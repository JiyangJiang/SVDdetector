# SVDdetector
SVDdetector is a set of MATLAB-based pipelines to segment MRI markers of cerebral small vessel disease, including white matter hyperintensities, dilated perivascular spaces, lacunes, and cerebral microbleeds. SPM12 functions are heavily used in SVDdetector. It is currently work-in-progress.
